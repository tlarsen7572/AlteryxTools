# Alteryx Tools

Custom Alteryx tools built using the Python and HTML GUI SDKs.

## Installation

Download zip files from the [releases](https://github.com/Alteryx-Python/AlteryxTools/releases) page.  Each zip file contains a YXI installer and a sample workflow.  Run the YXI installer to install the custom tool.

## Tools

* Regex Extract: Searches a field of text for a matching regular expression and extracts all matches into separate records.
* Field Sorter: Re-orders fields using a stable configuration that does not change with changes to incoming fields.  Fields may be sorted by matching exact values or regular expression patterns.
* Glassdoor Scraper: Scrapes reviews from Glassdoor.
* SSAS Importer: Allows users to import data from SSAS using an MDX query.  This custom tool is not yet pre-packaged; the user must build and install it themselves.
